// === THE PUZZLE: ===

// Make four functions, place_top, place_bot, pop_top, and pop_bot,
// which respectively:
//
// -- Push a card onto the top of the stack (represented by the
//    owned linked list above); return the new top of the stack.
//
// -- Place a card beneath the stack.  For an empty stack, the placed
//    card is returned as the top of the newly formed stack;
//    otherwise, the old stack top is returned (since the stack is
//    imperatively modified).
//
// -- Pop the top of the stack, returning a tuple of the popped card
//    and the new, potentially empty stack
//
// -- Remove the bottom of the stack (i.e. "cheat"), returning a tuple
//    of the removed card and the new, potentially empty stack

// [c1, ..., cN], cX -> [cX, c1, ..., cN]

fn place_bot_rec_1(pile: Option<~card>, newcard: ~card) -> ~card {
    fn recur(pile: Option<~card>, newcard: ~card) -> ~card {
        match pile {
            None => newcard,
            Some(~card {suit, rank, next}) => {
                let next = Some(recur(next, newcard)); // FIXME Q1.

            }
        }
    }
    recur(pile, newcard)
}

// Q1, Option 2:
fn place_bot_rec_2(pile: Option<~card>, newcard: ~card) -> ~card {
    fn recur(pile: &mut ~card, newcard: ~card) {
        match pile.next {
            None => {
                pile.next = Some(newcard);

        }
    }
}

// Question Q1: How can I change the code above to get rid of the
//   `copy`; I "just" want to walk down the list...
//
// * Above are two versions.  A version using a loop could be done but I
//   believe it is blocked by borrow checker bugs that would be fixed
//   with my rewrite.

// Question Q2: What interface "makes most sense" for place_bot
//   function?  In particular, what form should the pile take:
//   -- fn place_bot(Option<~card>, ~card) -> ~card,
//   -- fn place_bot(&Option<~card>, ~card) -> ~card, or
//   -- fn place_bot(~Option<~card>, ~card) -> ~card  ?
//
// * I would use `Option<~card>` if you want to keep the code more-or-less
//   as you wrote it.  Another appealing option would be something like
//
//     fn append(list: &mut Option<~card>, ~card)
//
//   This version would overwrite the list in place. Part of the
//   appeal of this is that it would allow you to append to lists
//   without the function taking ownership of them, which is sometimes
//   needed.  We can only pass by value when the value resides in an
//   owned location, but someone who possesed an `&mut Option<~card>`
//   could invoke `append()`.  The difference is that, in the
//   `append()` version, there is never a moment where the list has
//   been moved into the callee.


// [c1, c2, ..., cN] -> (c1, [c2, ..., cN])
fn pop_top(pile: ~card) -> (~card, Option<~card>) {

    let mut rest = None;

}

            None => (pile, None),

                pile.next = newcards; // FIXME Q3 (updates whole way back up).

                return None;
            }
            &Some(~card {next: ref mut n, _}) => {
                result = recur(n);
            }
        }

        if result.is_none() {
            *ptr <-> result;
        }

        return result;
    }
}

// Question Q3: Is there a way to write pop_bot so it only modifies
//   the linked-list *once*, at next-to-last cons-cell in the series?
//
// * Yes, see pop_bot_1 above.  It feels a bit awkward though,
//   particularly the call to `get()`.  You could write this
//   iteratively, I think, under the new borrow checker rules.

// Question Q4: I had a really hard time coming up with even the
//   solution above.  (I had spent much time last night struggling
//   with trying to do it via direct modifications, but even then
//   I never really consider using the swap operation to avoid
//   lending `pile`, as I had originally done when I wrote it
//   as `match pile.next { ... }`.  Any suggestions for heuristics
//   or design-principles for attacking such problems here?
//
// * Not sure.  I think that (1) I need to land the borrow checker rewrite;
//   (2) it probably is worth improving the liveness analysis to consider
//   partial moves and replacements; and (3) I guess we need to try and
//   come up with a better answer. ;)
//
//   I guess the key point is that you can use `&mut` to drill down into
//   your structure, but when you do that, you lose access to the outer
//   levels until your `&mut` pointer expires.  But that is sufficient
//   for these sorts of problems, generally speaking.

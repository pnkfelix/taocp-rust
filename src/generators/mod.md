Knuth speaks of "generating" all of the combinatorial objects that we need,
and "visiting" each object in turn.

For this go-round, lets take a shot at trying to encode this via the
Rust iterator API.

```rust
pub mod n_tuples;
```

Eventually I will have unit tests, either here or in the submodules.

For now this can be a placeholder to remind me of that.

```
#[test]
fn works2() { }
```
